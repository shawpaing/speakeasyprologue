Choice B and C text works but sprites are not there yet

Positioning of sprites may be weird/awkward - needs fixing

Car sprite is missing when driving and Vince is missing a toothy smile. We have the image files but I'm too lazy

You can only close the side menu by pressing one of the menu buttons or scrolling up (go back)

We did NOT work with layered images in this first creation - we wish to do so with our next release.

Might be forgetting to write more things.
